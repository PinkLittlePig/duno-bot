# Archived
This was one of the first projects I worked on so the code is a mess and many things are done wrong so that's why I am archiving it. Despite this I am still quite proud of this as the fact that I got this working at all is a miracle. Most of the code was written in the summer of 2019 so it is also quite out of date and since I didn't know about requirement files at the time good luck finding the version of discord.py this works with. I hope to create a new version of this once discord.py v2.0 is out and I finish the projects I am currently working on.
